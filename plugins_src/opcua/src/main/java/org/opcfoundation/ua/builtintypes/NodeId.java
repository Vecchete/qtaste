/* This file is derived from the javadoc API provided in the Prosys OPC-UA Java SDK Client/Server evaluation package (release 2.2.6-708)
 * As seen as, for licensing reasons, QTaste may not redistribute the Prosys OPC-UA Java SDK client jar file, the needed classes and methods are mocked-up to allow to build QTaste and all the testAPIs without requiring the Prosys OPC-UA Java SDK client jar file at build time.
 * None of those mock-up classes are present in the QTaste jars file.  
 * 
 * For using the QTaste OPC-UA testAPI, you'll need to contact Prosys (www.prosysopc.com) to obtain the OPC-UA Java SDK client jar file and add a dependency to this jar file in the pom.xml of your testapi folder.
