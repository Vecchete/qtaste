QTaste
======

QTaste framework (QSpin Tailored Automated System Test Environment) is a generic test environment customizable to test
different kind of systems. It can be used to test simple and complex hardware or software systems including a lot of different
technologies. For that reason, the test api has to be “tailored” in order to enable the kernel to communicate with your system.


The QTaste framework is mainly developed in java programming language and python. So by definition, it can be installed
on any platform running java VM 1.8. However, it has been only validated on Windows (Windows 8) and Linux platform.
